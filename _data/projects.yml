    a knowledge platform for the crypto-community
  description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
    kryptokrauts aims to be a knowledge platform for the crypto-community created by people for people.
    We have many cool ideas we want to bring to life.
    Currently the project is in its infancy but I am really curious about its future.
    A very cool thing is our [crypto-timeline](https://kryptokrauts.com/timeline) to which everybody
    is invited to [contribute](https://kryptokrauts.com/log/how-to-contribute)!

    a Java-SDK to communicate with the æternity blockchain
  description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
    The motivation to create a Java-SDK for the æternity blockchain was to enable a possible integration of æternity
    into the multi-blockchain wallet provider [ArkaneNetwork](https://arkane.network).
    Shortly after the first release was published I contributed to the [blockchain-providers](https://github.com/ArkaneNetwork/blockchain-providers)
    of ArkaneNetwork and added the æternity integration.

    It is currently the only available Java-SDK and still in active development by [Michel Meier](https://github.com/mitch-lbw) and myself.

    awarded as "best technical implementation" during the blockchain-hackathon 2019 in Stuttgart

    Identity of Things enables the unique decentralized verification of any type of products using a miniscule NFC
    and Secure Element based device, designed for those corporations, which truly care about their brand.
    This small device helps anyone to verify the authenticity of the product by using cryptographic methodology
    leveraging the secret key in tamper-proof Secure Element and maintaining the public key in Smart Contracts on the Ethereum blockchain.
    Moreover, we use the ENS (Ethereum Name Service) technology to associate the registry of the products to the respective brand.
